# Hi, I'm Michelle! 
## Welcome to my portifolio as a Quality Assurance Analyst

I usually say that I was born to be a QA professional, not because of any family tech heritage, but rather as a curious user who always finds bugs along the way. But the truth is, it was during a React.js class that a teacher showed me the path. He used to work as a testing developer and told us that being able to think about the types of errors a system can bring up or even find them easily is a desirable talent in many areas. So since that day, I have been studying testing and quality.

 <br/>Final Assignment - Project "O QA t√° ON" - <a href ="https://jogajuntoinstituto.org/">Instituto Joga Junto</a></h3>
 
 The final assignment had the objective of applying all that we learned during the classes, using the mobile app Rappi as a case study.
 - Organization:
 <br/>We chose to use a hybrid methodology with Scrum and Kanban. We held daily meetings to report on our testing progress and align our needs. By using Kanban in Trello, we were able to manage the priority of our tasks and the flow of our work. (image below).

 - Tests and scenarios:
 <br/> Three major test scenarios were proposed: <i>Login, Purchase Flow, and Logout</i>. From there, we fleshed out the scenarios in <i>Gherkin</i> and conducted manual tests to verify if all scenarios could run without problems or result in a bug

As an extra step, we also conducted exploratory tests where we identified several bugs that were not covered in any scenario, such as untranslated text and buttons with broken links.

- The squad and my tasks:
<br/>As this was a team effort, I believe it is necessary to explain my individual experience. I served as the spokesperson for the team during the final presentation, but we all contributed equally to getting the job done. We all tested, wrote scenarios, reported bugs, generated test evidence, and participated in decisions related to scheduling and organization. It was an intense team collaboration experience.
